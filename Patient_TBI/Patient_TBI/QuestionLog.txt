2     Good Morning Mr Smith How are you doing today     Good,Morning,Mr,Smith,How,are,doing,today,
3     I am Dr Trauma and this is a polytrauma clinic  You are here because you have earlier screened positive for TBI So this is the next step evaluation in those who screened positive for TBI The initial screen is usually very brief and does not give us a lot of information to diagnose someone with TBI  In this session I will be asking you more detailed questions so that we can better understand your symptoms and be able to come up with a specific diagnosis Do you have any questions for me at this time     I,am,Dr,Trauma,is,polytrauma,clinic,,are,here,have,earlier,screened,positive,TBI,So,next,step,evaluation,who,initial,screen,usually,very,brief,does,not,give,lot,information,diagnose,someone,session,be,asking,more,detailed,questions,so,that,better,understand,your,symptoms,able,come,specific,diagnosis,Do,time,
4     Let me clarify it for you On your previous visit the doctor asked you a few brief questions to see if you screened positive for a more detailed evaluation which will be done today Screening positive does not mean that you have TBI      Let,clarify,your,previous,visit,doctor,asked,few,brief,questions,see,screened,positive,more,detailed,evaluation,which,be,done,today,Screening,does,not,mean,that,have,TBI,
5     Okay Lets get started I am going to ask you to describe for me in detail events you experienced in IraqAfghanistan during which time you directly experienced a powerful force or blow to your upper body or head You may or may not have been physically injured This might have happened in explosion or blast crashes or accidents fights falls or even during some sporting events I am interested in understanding this physical force on you Some events may be very emotionally powerful or upsetting but for now I am going to ask you to focus on the event that was most powerful or injurious Of course it may also have been emotionally disturbing      Lets,get,started,I,am,going,ask,describe,detail,events,experienced,IraqAfghanistan,which,time,directly,powerful,force,blow,your,upper,body,head,not,have,been,physically,injured,happened,explosion,blast,crashes,accidents,fights,falls,even,sporting,interested,understanding,physical,be,very,emotionally,upsetting,now,focus,event,that,was,most,injurious,course,also,disturbing,

9     So were you metavaced       So,were,metavaced,
10     Impact could vary depending on several factors such as how far you were from the blast site did you fall away did you have any penetrating wounds did you lose consciousness etc 
Let me just brief you a bit about it 
When a high explosive bomb or IED goes off there is a âœblast waveâ which is a wave of highly compressed gas A couple of things could happen here one this wave hits a solid objects like a personâs body and one may feel like smashing into a wall two one could be âœpepperedâ with particles of sand debris shrapnel and fragments three you could be thrown to the ground or against some stationary object like a wall or vehicle Can you recall which of these three categories happened with you

18     Now letâs talk about your current symptoms I will ask you some specific symptoms that you might have experienced and I would like you to grade them based on their severity For example 
Nonezero mean that they are rarely ever present
One means that they are occasionally present but they do not disrupt your activities You can usually continue what you are doing and doesnât really concerns you
Two means that they are often present and occasionally disrupt your activity You can usually continue to do what you are doing with some effort and you are somewhat concerned about it
Three means that they are frequently present and disrupts your regular activities You can only do things that are fairly simple or take little effort You feel like you need help 
Four means that they are almost always present and you have been unable to perform at work school or at home due to this problem You probably cannot function without help
Please let me know if you want me to repeat the grading criteria as it can be a bit confusing
